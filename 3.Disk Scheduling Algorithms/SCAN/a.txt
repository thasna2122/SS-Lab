Algorithm :SCAN


Step 1 : create an array trackmovement[] 
Step 2 : set i = 0
Step 3 : set cur_track = 0
Step 4 : read tracklist
Step 5 : sort tracklist
Step 6 : find the position of cur_track in tracklist
Step 7 : print all track in tracklist from the cur_track to the end of tracklist
Step 8 : print all track in tracklist in reverse order from cur_track to the beginning of tracklist
