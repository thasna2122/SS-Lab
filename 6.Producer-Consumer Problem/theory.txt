Producer-consumer problem, is a common paradigm for cooperating processes. A producer process produces
information that is consumed by a consumer process. One solution to the producer-consumer problem uses 
shared memory. To allow producer and consumer processes to run concurrently, there must be available a 
buffer of items that can be filled by the producer and emptied by the consumer. This buffer will reside 
in a region of memory that is shared by the producer and consumer processes. A producer can produce one
 item while the consumer is consuming another item. The producer and consumer must be synchronized, 
so that the consumer does not try to consume an item that has not yet been produced.
