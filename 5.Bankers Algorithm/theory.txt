In a multiprogramming environment, several processes may compete for a finite number of resources. 
A process requests resources; if the resources are not available at that time, the process enters
 a waiting state. Sometimes, a waiting process is never again able to change state, because 
the resources it has requested are held by other waiting processes. This situation is called a 
deadlock. Deadlock avoidance is one of the techniques for handling deadlocks. This 
approach requires that the operating system be given in advance additional information 
concerning which resources a process will request and use during its lifetime. With this 
additional knowledge, it can decide for each request whether or not the process should wait. 
To decide whether the current request can be satisfied or must be delayed, the system must consider
 the resources currently available, the resources currently allocated to each process, 
and the future requests and releases of each process. Banker’s algorithm is a deadlock 
avoidance algorithm that is applicable to a system with multiple instances of each resource type.
